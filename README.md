## Installation
This program uses regular Python libraries. You should not need to install anything additional.

## Usage
The program prompts allowing you to have different experiences and do a simple comparisson of 3 algorithms:
Your mind solving the Challenge
The Computer solving it using a fixed algorithm placing the Queens in order
The Computer solving it using random positions with recursive logic to solve the Challenge

## Features
-Bit logic to represent the chessboard using 44 bytes vs. 120 bytes for a simplier array [[0 for col in range(8)] for row in range(8)]
-Each board position is encoded using two bits to represent: 00 Empty, 01 Attacked, 10 Queen, 11 Not Used
-All the functions use Chess Standard Notation A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H for Columns 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 for Rows
-Using the Interation Mode you can compute different solutions, experiment increasing the number of iterations to see the progression of time vs. number of solutions found

## Contributing
-Change from text in Command Line to a GUI
-Adapt the algoritm to use a standard array [[0 for col in range(8)] for row in range(8)] to benchmark performance
-Find out if implementing ML can provide the same number of solutions using less cycles
-Use MathPlot to graph a curve on computing cycles vs. time comparing bit encoding vs. standard array
